It’s my second ML tutorial; much deeper and longer than the first. Obviously the instructor is the real deal: an experienced professional data scientist (see LinkedIn and GitHub accounts). Consequently, the course is very broad and detailed at the same time; not the usually 25-minute fluff-piece “Here’s Machine Learning!”\n",

It’s my second ML tutorial; much deeper and longer than the first. Obviously the instructor is the real deal: an experienced professional data scientist (see LinkedIn and GitHub accounts).
